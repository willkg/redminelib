This is a library of stuff that I threw together to scrape a Redmine
instance to migrate my bug data to another issue tracking system.


Note about usefulness
=====================

While I tried to design this with utility in mind, it's only really
been used for my stuff and it targets the Redmine instance I needed
to migrate stuff from.  It's not clear at the time of this writing
as to whether this will be useful for other people.


Requirements
============

* lxml


How to use
==========

Install it by getting the source and then doing::

    python setup.py install


Feedback, bug reports, etc
==========================

I plan to work on this project for as long as I have a need for this
code.  Beyond that, it'll hang out until someone else takes it over.

In the meantime, feel free to direct feedback, bug reports, etc to
willg at bluesock dot org.  I probably won't work on it, but I can at least
pass all the information on to the next person.
